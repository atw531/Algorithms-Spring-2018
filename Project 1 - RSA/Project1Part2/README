This project is used to sign and verify files using the RSA algorithm.

run rsa435 with the proper arguments:
	First argument values may be "s" or "v"
		"s" is used to sign a file
		"v" is used to verify a file
	Second argument is the original file name with extension
	
	Signing example:
		rsa.exe s File.txt
		- This will sign the provided file, "File.txt", storing the
			signature in the file "File.txt.signature".
		- You will be prompted to either generate new keys or use existing keys
		- Enter "Y" to generate a new set of keys and "N" to use existing keys
		- If you choose to use existing keys, but none are found, then new keys
			will be automatically generated
		- Generating keys may take up to 8 minutes, so be patient
	
	Verify example:
		rsa.exe v File.txt
		- This will verify the provided file, based off of the signature in 
			the file "File.txt.signature"
